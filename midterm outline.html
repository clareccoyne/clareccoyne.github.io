    <h1>
        For my midterm I want to create a net art piece that also plays as an adventure game.
    </h1>
    <h2>## inspo!!</h2>
    <p>I really liked the pieces we looked in class that had the text link navagation. In addition, I'm going to take inspiration from CameronsWorld, which was one of the Net Art pieces that I looked at for our assignment. Also, I really like the storyline and navagation of super mario galaxy. I plan to use the galaxy theme for my map, and then create little worlds inside the game where you can play through mini adventures. </p>

<body>
	<div id="planet" ></div>
    <div id="world1" ></div>
    <div id="world2" ></div>
    <div id="world3" ></div>
    <div id="world4" ></div>
    <div id="world5" ></div>
    <div id="world6" ></div>

    <p>for my aesthetic choices, I plan to go with a retro look (similar to cameronsworld) I'll use lots of images, a little bit of text for explanations, and a dark background to keep with the galaxy theme.</p>
