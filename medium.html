            <p> Medium, as Marshall McLuhan states, is “any extension of ourselves.” 

                McLuhan describes that, “…it is the medium that shapes and controls the scale and form of human association and action.” Human association and action are the main aspects that define how we build and experience our own lives. McLuhan also claims  that, “…it is only too typical that the ‘content’ of any medium blinds us to the character of the medium.”, which is interesting because it seems he's saying that we as humans can blind ourselves when it comes to personal character. We tend to value content over character, which shows that humanity can be materialistic in every sense. 
                
                Something that stuck with me is the quote: “Nothing follows from following, except change.” which is proven to be true, especially currently during the age of media. Every significant occurence is provoked by what we see (or what we follow) in the media.</p>
